/**
 * Asset-packaging contract: `npm pack` must include every viewer asset
 * the runtime server reads from `dist/viewer/assets/`. If a future
 * package.json change drops `dist/` from `files`, or the tsup
 * `onSuccess` hook silently fails to populate the assets directory,
 * the published tarball would ship a viewer that 500s on `GET /`.
 *
 * Uses `npm pack --dry-run --json` so the test inspects the file list
 * without writing a tarball into the working tree.
